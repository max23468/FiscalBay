title: Metadata API
description: "The **Metadata API** lets you retrieve metadata on eBay category policies, information on sales tax jurisdictions, and available hazardous material related label information. _Category policies_ are the eBay policies and guidelines for how you must list certain items in specific categories across the different eBay marketplaces. For example, if you are listing items with variations, you'll want to know which categories support multiple-variation listings. Another example is that you may want to know which item conditions are supported for different eBay categories. See [Finding the correct category ID and item condition for your item](/api-docs/sell/static/metadata/getting-metadata.html#s0-1-31-4-7-5-content) [](/api-docs/sell/metadata/overview.html#policies)for more information. Several countries have _sales tax jurisdictions_ where the tax rates across the different jurisdictions may vary. You can use the Metadata API to retrieve the lists of tax jurisdictions which you can then use to set up sales tax tables. See [Getting a list of tax jurisdictions](/api-docs/sell/static/metadata/getting-metadata.html#jurisdictions) for more information. Sellers have the ability to add _hazardous material related label_ information to their listings. See [Specifying hazardous material related information](/api-docs/sell/static/metadata/feature-regulatorhazmatcontainer.html) for more information."

**Description:** This method retrieves a list of shipping services supported for the specified marketplace, including valid shipping services, shipping times, and package constraints such as size and weight.

Manage shipping services using business policies through the **fulfillment\_policy** resource of the **Account v1 API**.

  - This header is required to retrieve metadata for the French Canada, French Belgium, and Dutch Belgium marketplaces.
