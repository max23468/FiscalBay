Sellers can manage shipment labels by uploading using the **Media API** and attaching them with the **attachReturnShipmentLabel** mutation.

This is applicable for non-trackable returns where tracking information is unavailable, such as freight shipments. For tracked shipments, the return will be automatically recorded as received when the tracking information indicates that the item has been delivered to the destination address.

**Returns:** `RecordReturnReceivedOutput!`

- **input** (RecordReturnReceivedInput!)
